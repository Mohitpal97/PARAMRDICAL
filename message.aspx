It is proved as a milestone in the treatment of communicable diseases. In other words, we can say that paramedical science is a backbone for medical science because right diagnosis of any disease is Necessary to prevent fatal diseases. Thus, medical Science can't take even a single step without paramedical science.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtChairmanP2">These paramedical courses are pointing towards a revolutionary changes. These courses have provided job opportunities in medical field in India. Paramedical science is emerging as a multi-dimensional branch of science which is full filled with great opportunities.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtChairmanP3">As paramedical is only capable of removing & diagnosing different diseases, it has given way to career opportunities and played an important role in improving the health conditions of people. Paramedics are the key players in the Health & Medical Sector. Without paramedics, the entire Health Industry is out of gear and is almost non-functionary. If there are no Paramedics, there is neither money nor any profit for doctors, hospitals, private clinics, etc.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtChairmanP4">There is an increasing realization on the importance of paramedical personnel in the health sector, especially in accident and trauma care. Paramedics are a boon to nursing homes and the dreams for students, who have not been able to become full-fledged medical professionals. Health care delivery systems are undergoing rapid changes and the demand for skilled paramedical personnel is on the rise. Almost all the diagnostic procedures are carried out by the paramedical staff and they have emerged a vital cog in the wheel of the health care delivery system. The population explosion coupled with the mushrooming of private and corporate hospitals has provided numerous opportunities for skilled paramedics.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtChairmanP5">Now, what's important is to know more about such 'professionals' who do a Blood Test or a massage or a therapy and aid the doctor for better treatment of the patient & hence make health care easy and effective. These Professionals are called as "Paramedics."</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtChairmanP6">Medical education is very important. Without the proper education, no one would be treated properly for serious injuries or sickness. These are different types of medical education. There are people who go into the billing and coding aspect of the medical field, while others prefer to be hands on with the patients. The longest medical education is to become a doctor or surgeon. Ones who have a specialty have to take longer time getting to know their expertise and carrying out medical procedures. It is a great accomplishment, but it takes a great deal of time and work. It takes so long to become particular nurses and doctors because people's lives are at hand. You must know what you are doing before you can administer any drug or diagnose a patient. But no other profession is as rewarding as Medical and Paramedical profession because of so high moral, monetary & repetitive satisfaction in the society. With these words I welcome you to Emerging India Paramedical & Nursing Council.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtAddDirectorMessagepara1">Un-Employment is the major problem in India very qualified and highly experienced persons wandering here and there for employment. A large no of multinational companies giving the opportunities to Indian Un – Employed educated youths but not paying salary as per the qualification and their experience even not giving the employment assurance in future. Any time they should be kicked out without any notice 2nd point of the Un- Employment is the lack of knowledge to choose the field of educating .The Mentality of the 80% Unemployed educated youths is to get the job in Govt Service, so with the frustration may Un-employed choose the fatal ends of fails in criminal activities.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtAddDirectorMessagepara2">To control this critical problem council decided to run different Paramedical Courses. Paramedical are the back bone of Medical Treatments.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 13px" runat="server" id="txtAddDirectorMessagepara3">This sector have great opportunities to set up under self –employment for every un-employed after completion of 10  or 10+2 stream. Thousands of students of the council living better than the Govt. employees and running their own medical labs, Dental labs, Optical Centers, Physiotherapy Centers –Ray & E.C.G centers and providing First –Aid in field of Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Essential Drugs. At least I want to say that this is the right choice for the Un-employed youths or fresher's to get the respectfully business opportunities. So you have to choose the Para Medical field as per your interested line.</p>
